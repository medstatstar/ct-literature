# Changelog · ct-literature

All notable changes to this skill are documented here. Versioning follows the
ct- library convention (B-tier public-intel skill, semver-ish).

## v0.5.7 — 2026-08-11

### Pre-publish hardening pass (ct-base BASE.md §16 checklist)
- **Fixed missing `scripts/i18n_messages.json`** — the ct-base shared generic i18n key set was never injected (omitted from `.ctbase_injected.json`'s file list), so `_MESSAGES` fell back to `{}` and every generic i18n key (`exec.running`, `error.generic`, `info.result_saved`, …) rendered as its raw key string at runtime. Copied the ct-base shared `i18n_messages.json` into `scripts/`; Excel UI keys stay self-contained in `export_xlsx._LOCAL`, domain keys inline in their consuming scripts (per §16.3).
- **SKILL.md 214 → 199 lines** (≤200, §16.1): trimmed the Cross-Database and Natural-language-dialogue sections.
- **Hardened `.gitignore` / `.clawhubignore`**: added `.ctbase_injected.json`, `*.ctbase_bak_*`, `tests/smoke_out/`, `.env.*`; removed a tracked `.ctbase_injected.json` (machine-specific absolute path) via `git rm --cached`.
- **references language (§16.2)**: rewrote `citation_styles.md` to English-only; stripped Chinese trigger phrases from `multi-db-search.md` (English trigger list + note that Chinese triggers mirror SKILL.md `triggers`).
- **No hardcoded Chinese output strings (§16.3)**: `abstract_translator.py` / `mesh_mapper.py` argparse help + `print` changed to English. `export_html.py` keeps ` / `-separated bilingual labels (policy-compliant); `obsidian_exporter.py` keeps `lang`-conditional bilingual.
- Not published — push/publish pending user confirmation.

## v0.5.6 — 2026-08-11

### Source expansion (real network, 10×10 hardening regression passed)
- **Europe PMC is now ON by default** (`with_europepmc=True`; `--no-with-europepmc` to disable). It is free/keyless and gives the whole PubMed/PMC/MEDLINE/MeSH pool, so the previous opt-in default (OpenAlex-only) was leaving the highest-value biomedical source off by default.
- **Added bioRxiv + medRxiv** as opt-in `--with-biorxiv` / `--with-medrxiv` (Tier P preprints). Neither has a free keyword-search API, so both are pulled through Europe PMC's preprint corpus (`SRC:PPR` + `publisher:` filter) and emitted with distinct `bioRxiv` / `medRxiv` provenance in the merged record.
- **Added arXiv** as opt-in `--with-arxiv` (keyless Atom API). Mostly methodology/ML/CS breadth for clinical questions, so kept opt-in (rank priority 1, sinks below biomedical sources).
- New fetchers: `scripts/fetch_preprints.py` (bioRxiv/medRxiv via EPMC PPR) and `scripts/fetch_arxiv.py` (arXiv Atom parser, with retry).
- `normalize._SOURCE_PRIORITY` extended: bioRxiv/medRxiv = 0 (primary biomedical), arXiv = 1 (supplementary, like SemanticScholar).

## v0.5.3 — 2026-08-08

- .env key 轻混淆（XOR+base64）防误打包明文扫描命中；http_utils.py 增加 `_deobfuscate` 向后兼容明文 .env；三平台同步发布。

## v0.5.2 — 2026-08-08

### Follow-up security audit cleanup (ClawHub SkillSpector, post-0.5.1)
- **Closed the residual Ssd3 (paste-key-to-chat) finding**: v0.5.1 removed the
  "paste your key to the assistant" prompt from `scripts/i18n.py`, but the same
  guidance was still present in README "Example 4 · Configure the OpenAlex key"
  (both `README.md` and `README_zh-CN.md`). Rewrote both to self-config only —
  `.env` / env var / `--openalex-key` — with an explicit "never paste a key into
  chat" statement. This was the true source of the 98%-confidence Ssd3 hit
  (the scanner reads the README, not just scripts).
- **Cleared the Unpinned Dependencies (Low) finding**: `requirements.txt` no
  longer declares `requests>=2.28`. `requests` is not a runtime dependency —
  fetch uses stdlib `urllib`, and the R-bridge (`r_libs.py`) was removed in
  0.5.1. The reserved optional `requests` import in `fetch_openalex.py` is noted
  with a pin-if-enabled comment.

## v0.5.1 — 2026-08-08

### Security audit remediation (ClawHub SkillSpector, post-0.5.0)
- **Removed API-key paste-to-assistant guidance**: deleted the conversational
  "paste your key to the assistant" prompts in `scripts/i18n.py`
  (`openalex.key_notice` / `semantic_scholar.key_notice`) and reverted to the
  self-service methods in `references/openalex_key.md` (Method A/B/C: `.env`,
  env var, or `--openalex-key`). Clarified the key is user-private, stored
  locally, sent only over HTTPS to the official API, and must never be pasted
  into chat — also resolves an internal contradiction with openalex_key.md §7.
- **Removed arbitrary R code execution primitive**: `scripts/r_libs.py` no longer
  imports `run_r` / `subprocess` / `tempfile`; it keeps only validation /
  sanitization helpers. ct-literature is pure-Python and never calls R, so the
  "Context-Inappropriate Capability" finding is eliminated at the root. The shared
  `ct-base/scripts/r_libs.py` was likewise stripped of `run_r` (execution
  primitives are no longer shared from the base), and `ct-base/BASE.md` §16.4 / §2
  / §10 references were updated to match.
- Dropped dead R-related i18n keys (`dry_run.*`, `exec.*`, `install.*`,
  `header.*`, etc.) that were only referenced by the removed R runner.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-08-08

### Initial public release (init version)
- First public release of ct-literature; consolidates the v0.3.x internal
  hardening aligned with ct-base v1.1.18 (i18n locale-aware strings, README
  rebuilt on the ct-advisor skeleton, `invocable: true` frontmatter, dual-author
  footer `medstatstar, phoe-zip`, packaging exclusions in `.clawhubignore`).
- The full compliance changelog carried into this release is recorded under
  v0.3.12 below.

## v0.3.12 — 2026-08-08

### Compliance & documentation (aligned with ct-base v1.1.18)
- **SKILL.md**: added `invocable: true` to frontmatter (task-entry skill, per BASE.md §16.5).
- **README (EN + ZH)**: added two dialogue-flow examples covering the two branches
  from `references/search_menu.md` — Complex (popup confirmation menu, §4.1–§4.3)
  and Vague (grill-me style clarifying questions, §6).
- Bumped version v0.3.11 → v0.3.12 across SKILL.md / AGENTS.md / both READMEs.

### Prior hardening (carried into this release)
- **i18n**: moved all hardcoded Chinese `print`/docstrings in `scripts/` to
  `i18n.py` en+zh key pairs (locale-aware) — clears BASE.md §16.3.
- **README (EN + ZH)**: restructured to the ct-advisor skeleton
  (switch line → logo → intro → Who This Is For → 1.How to Use → 2.Scenarios →
  3.FAQ → 4.Security & Privacy → 5.Advanced); removed the "Future Release Plans"
  section to stay consistent with BASE.md §13.6.
- **SKILL.md**: English-only body; frontmatter re-ordered to the ct-base §3 schema.
- **AGENTS.md**: version aligned.
- **references/**: sop.md / openalex_key.md / search_menu.md / multi-db-search.md
  fully English-only.
- **Authors**: README footer version line set to `medstatstar, phoe-zip`
  (synced to the ct-base template).

### Packaging
- `.clawhubignore`: now excludes `tests/results/`, `tests/scenario10_run/`,
  `tests/scenario10b_run/`, `tests/__pycache__/`, plus global `__pycache__/` / `*.pyc`.
- `.gitignore`: already excludes `__pycache__/` / `*.pyc` (no change needed).

## v0.3.11
- Baseline B-tier public-intel literature search skill: OpenAlex (primary) +
  Europe PMC (MEDLINE/MeSH) + Semantic Scholar (citation ranking, optional),
  normalized merge + dedupe, CSM qualitative safety subset, Markdown + Excel + HTML output.
